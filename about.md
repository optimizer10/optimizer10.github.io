### What is Optimizer10?

Optimizer10 is a free Windows 10 Optimization Tool that can help you apply Windows tweaks just in few clicks. This tool gives you opportunity to get rid of telemetry, unused system apps and much more. 

### Why do I need it?
Windows 10 requires some tweaks to enjoy the best user experience and performance. Applying those tweaks manually can take a long time so I made a thing to help you out :)
Sure, you can use batch/powershell scripts to do that but my tool gives you a little bit more control over optimization process and a user-friendly UI.

### How it was made?
It's an application made by me (<a href="https://github.com/rara64">rara64</a> ðŸ‘‹) in glorious C# language that works just as your typical script for optimizing Windows. It just adds a nice interface, a little bit control over what will be done in your system and some additional features like backup and restore option.
