***SmartScreen*** is in Windows for some time now - it even found its way into Windows 10 as an additional level of security. Every time you download an app from the Internet and it's not signed with a verified publisher certificate, SmartScreen will notify you about it and recommend not to run the app. If you are an experienced user, you might not need this extra layer of security. So, here's how to disable it.

First, open search from the taskbar and type the phrase ***"Windows Security"***, then click the result. Once we are in the Windows Security window locate the section called ***"App & browser control"*** and click it. After clicking it you can see a few options, disable all of them: ***Check apps and files, SmartScreen for Microsoft Edge, SmartScreen for Microsoft Store apps***. Now, you can close the Windows Security window and you have successfully disabled Windows SmartScreen.
